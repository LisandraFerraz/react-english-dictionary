## Dictionary Web APP

The project is a solution for [Frontend Mentor's challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL). It was build using React 18 with Typescript.

The goal was to fetch data from [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) and display the meaning of the searched word as well as an audio for better understanding of the pronunciation. The challenge is also composed of adding a color theme switch, which was made with a self made hook.
